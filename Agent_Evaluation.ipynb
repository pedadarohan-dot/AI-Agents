        "While **traditional evaluation methods rely on fixed test cases**, real-world conversations are dynamic and unpredictable. This is where User Simulation comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "User Simulation is a powerful feature in ADK that addresses the limitations of static evaluation. Instead of using pre-defined, fixed user prompts, User Simulation employs a generative AI model (like Gemini) to **dynamically generate user prompts during the evaluation process.**\n",

        "### ❓ How it works\n",
        "\n",
        "* You define a `ConversationScenario` that outlines the user's overall conversational goals and a `conversation_plan` to guide the dialogue.\n",
        "* A large language model (LLM) then acts as a simulated user, using this plan and the ongoing conversation history to generate realistic and varied prompts.\n",
        "* This allows for more comprehensive testing of your agent's ability to handle unexpected turns, maintain context, and achieve complex goals in a more natural, unpredictable conversational flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "User Simulation helps you uncover edge cases and improve your agent's robustness in ways that static test cases often miss.\n",

        "Now that you understand the power of User Simulation for dynamic agent evaluation, here's an exercise to apply it:\n",
