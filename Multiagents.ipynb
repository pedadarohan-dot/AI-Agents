Furthermore, if one agent encounters an issue, its counterparts can often compensate, ensuring continuous operation and boosting overall system availability. This distributed nature also opens doors to greater autonomy and intelligence. Agents can be programmed for proactive problem-solving, anticipating needs before they arise. They can also be infused with AI and machine learning capabilities, allowing them to learn from their operational history, optimize their performance over time, and even discover novel solutions to complex problems.\n",
